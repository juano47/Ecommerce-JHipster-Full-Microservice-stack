 - API management and Gateway using Spring Boot, Netflix Zuul, ReactJS, and Swagger.

 - Microservices using Spring Boot.

 - Monitoring using JHipster Console which is made of the Elastic stack(ELK) and Zipkin.

The Gateway routes incoming requests to two microservices, Invoice application, and Notification application.
